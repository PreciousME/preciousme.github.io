                    <p>Do you remember the day you opened your first bank account? What was it like? Did you have to walk into a bank? Did you have to fill long and clumsy forms? And how has banking affected your life meaningfully? Well, I can vividly remember. Not only the day but the reason why I thought I needed a bank account. Apparently, I started working at an early age and came to the consciousness that I needed to put my money in a bank.<br/><br/>
                        Traditional banking hasn't offered the ordinary man more than having to deposit money, withdraw money, transfer money, pay bills and that's all there is to offer. These banks haven't cared about our financial well-being. They only want us to deposit more money, make more transactions so that they can charge and make money for themselves; ripping us off not only of our money but also depriving us of one of the fundamental means to our existence - financial well-being.<br/><br/>

                            While these banks have been stuck in their old ways of doing things and trapped in their legacy systems, the world is changing rapidly.<br/><br/>
                            
                            Millennials are born into today's technology driven world where hailing a taxi is as simple as tapping twice on a glass, right in the comfort of their couch. Billions of people have shifted the way they shop, socialize and manage their lives squarely into the virtual world, where they have grown accustomed to a level of convenience, hyper-relevant service that they rarely experience in the physical world—and which banks struggle to match.<br/><br/>
                            
                            Meanwhile, banks have continued to focus on what worked in the old environment.
                            Their investments in digitization have focused on improving efficiency and easy
                            wins. Only a few valiant ones are using digital to generate new growth.<br/><br/>
                            
                            One will argue that these banks are going digital. USSD? Works for the basics and is not scalable. ATMS? Not all that. Apps? Poorly designed and only stocked with same old services. Digital isn't enough! Financial technology isn't about systems and channels, it's the innovative use of technology in the design and delivery of financial services. And finance is a fundamental part of our lives, and banks have failed to help us in making the most of it.

                    <h2>Imaging what you wish your bank could do</h2>
                    <p>Imagine a bank where opening an account was as easy as signing up for Facebook.<br/>

                        Imagine a bank Where you never walk into a hall again. I mean, you don't have to go to Uber's office to sign up for ride-hailing. Neither do you have to go to their office to make complaints. Wonder why today's millennials could tweet at their Banks rather than walk into the banking halls.<br/><br/>
                            
                            Imagine a bank where you could track everything you spend your money on, and that uses innovative technology to offer you the best service because it knows everything about your finances.<br/><br/>
                            
                            Imagine a bank that uses smart analytics to give you the best service and lets you be in control at the same time.<br/><br/>
                            
                            Imagine a financial marketplace where merchants can buy financial services.<br/><br/>
                            
                            Imagine a fully digitized loan-application process that not only reduces approval time but
                            also provides more accurate underwriting/credit monitoring, which can make it possible for
                            a bank to offer loans at lower rates. A bank with real-time validation and authentication, where loan approvals could be granted in one hour.<br/><br/>
                            
                            Imagine a bank that identifies your purchasing power, and giving you the right services and advice based on that.<br/><br/>
                            
                            Imagine a bank that uses anonymized and aggregated data to make the entire financial sector a viable one for customers and players in the banking space. A bank central to the daily lives of customers by addressing core life needs.<br/><br/>
                            
                            Imagine a bank that uses artificial intelligence-based systems to offer personalized in-depth advice right at your fingertips.<br/><br/>
                            
                            Imagine a bank that places a relentless focus on customer experience and looks for new ways to make life easier.<br/><br/>
                            
                            Imagine a bank where Small business owners would be able to combine accounting and business data with banking data in one place, creating up-to-date financial reports that provide an accurate and timely view of cashflow thereby helping SMEs improve financial management and enable better decision making.<br/><br/>
                            
                            Imagine a bank that helps you track your spending so you know where your money is going.<br/><br/>
                            
                            Imagine a bank that saves money for you instead of taking money from you in form of charges.<br/><br/>

                <h2>Setting the stage</h2>
                <h3>Assembling a team of technology, design, project management and financial experts</h3>
                <p>Advance's bold ideas were invigorating but yet I could sense that this project was something of great magnitude. Designing the experience that these ideas would sit upon needed more than the usual. Although, I had lead the team that designed one of Africa’s leading banks corporate website, designing a unique digital banking experience was different.<br/><br/>

                        The people at Advance are a team of financial technology experts. They had done their homework even before contacting me. They had a great idea, had put up great tech. But they needed their ideas brought to life through design.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Amongst the team for this project was Praise, the project manager, Lola, researcher and analyst, Tunji iOS Developer, Femi, Java and Android Developer. I  joined as the designer on the project. I knew this project needed more than just me as a designer, and so I called up my friend Derek, an interaction designer to come on the board. Other stakeholders included Edmund, the CEO with vast experience in financial technology and innovation, banking and financial experts who made blurry parts on banking, finance and loan clearer for all stakeholders on the project.</p>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>We knew we needed to learn more about the financial services space. Our naive assumptions were going to mislead us if we didn't question them. We knew we needed to understand how banking form the core of peoples' lives. Hence we had to answer a few questions:</p>
                    <ul class="goals-list">
                            <li><p>What does banking mean to people?</p></li>
                            <li><p>Do people care about their financial status?</p></li>
                            <li><p>How do people manage their money?</p></li>
                            <li><p>Are people aware of other services and products aside usual cash and dash services?</p></li>
                            <li><p>Do people budget, and how?</p></li>
                            <li><p>Do people need loans? And how do they get them?</p></li>
                            <li><p>Do people save? How? And why not?</p></li>
                            <li><p>What are current pain points that people using already existing digital banking app or channels have?</p></li>
                            <li><p>Are people open to a digital-only banking?</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>
                            We also needed to know what external sources the app is going to interface with, so we'd know how to implement data into the design.<br/><br/>

                            Edmund's research team had already done their research and handed I and Derek facts, and features list they had created based on their research. We analyzed and went through tons of articles, facts, and diagrams while drawing out key insights and assumptions.<br/><br/>
                            
                            To further see things from our own perspective, I and Derek knew we needed to interview people. The core demographic for Advance bank are millennials, young professionals and small businesses,<br/><br/>
                            
                            We started with our neighbors whom we sat down with and had in-depth conversations with; from what they thought about banking & finance,  to their spending habits, financial challenges, investing, their lifestyle, daily routines all-what's-not. We also sent emails to a few friends whom we interviewed via Skype (Thanks to Papi, Dozie and Nneka). <br/><br/>
                            
                            Following this process, we drafted personas from where we drew out key insights

                    <h2>Ideation & Design</h2>
                    <h3>The buffet</h3>
                    <p>Having understood the problem, we broke down the solution into 5 core experiences. Account, Budget, Loans, Savings, Insights & Financial Advise, Transfers, payments and products, and yet baking them together into one fine great experience.</br><br/>
                        We started by thinking about the architecture. How do we put together these experiences in such a way that we have robust and scalable experience yet simple. Should we start with on-boarding we thought? People want to first get to speed. We analyzed several details while putting our personas at the center of our thinking. One core goal that stood out in the personas we created was that people wanted an all in one banking experience so simple that they never had to think about the stress of having to go to the banking halls. This inspired us to create a navigation system that ushered users into the banking experience all at a glance. No queues, no having to fill long forms. Just all you need on your finger tips.<br/><br/>
                            Analyzing all facets that made up the entire financial lives of our targeted users, we went on to lay out these experiences into core parts of one whole experience. We called it Buffet.</p>

                        <p>We decided to take on these core aspects one by one, while making sure they all pointed to our north star.</p>

                        </ul>
                    <p>We researched how other banks went about opening an account. We looked at Central Bank of Nigeria's policies on account opening and requirements. It was a lot.</br><br/>

                            All of us on the project have bank accounts with different banks, and we all shared our experiences opening an account with these banks. It was apparent how tedious an account opening process is at all incumbent banks.</br><br/>
                           
                           Our job was to make this process simple as possible.</br><br/>
                           
                           We went with one mantra for account opening - download the app, signup with just phone number and password required, and there you have it, an account. We realized that most requirements were only necessary for certain kind of transactions, like loan, or opening a business account. So we decided to ask users for these requirements only when needed, at the point of enquiry.</br><br/>
                           
                           From our research, we realized there were more savings account than current accounts. The reason was because savings account required less documents and less initial cash to set up. Essentially, It was more accessible. Is there a way we could make current account more accessible, and how about other accounts that exist?</br><br/>
                           
                           Following our research, we decided to start out the product with the 2 most popular account types: Savings and Current.</br><br/>
                           
                           We laid out requirements for these type of accounts, and fleshed out a simple process for both.</p>

                        <p>Our goal for this project was to make banking as simple as possible, offer quick accessibility to users while considering scale, and a rapidly evolving industry.</br><br/>

                                Looking at our demographic and the kind of users we are targeting, it made sense to experiment with what our user base were already used to, – a timeline.</br><br/>
                                
                                We soon agreed on this approach. We knew we would only validate this by building and putting it out there. Importantly, we needed to ensure we had the right information on the timeline.</br><br/>
                                
                                We made accommodation for this feature by segmenting the app with a simple swipe. Users can swipe to see every detail at a glance, or swipe left to see important actions.</br><br/>
                                
                                Using a quadrant affinity map, we laid out all possible details that can go into the timeline, and streamlined them into Important/high impact, Important/low impact, Nice to have/high impact, nice to have/low mpact. We analyzed and made quick decisions.</br><br/>
                                
                                Users are first presented with their financial status, bank balance, budget status, etc, and users can perform necessary actions from the timeline based on context.</p>

                    <div class="loans case-heading">
                        <h2>Easy and accessible loans</h2>
                        <p>From the onset of the project, we knew the loans experience was a module we needed to understand, not only how loans work, but also how people think and go about loans.</p>
                        <h3 class="measure">We asked the questions:</h3>
                        <ul class="goals-list">
                            <li><p>Why loans?</p></li>
                            <li><p>What do people think about loans, and do they really care?</p></li>
                            <li><p>How do people seek for loans currently?</p></li>
                            <li><p>What are requirements?</p></li>
                            <li><p>How do we handle risk assessment?</p></li>
                            <li><p>Who's eligible for a loan, and why?</p></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>We carried out another series of interviews, where we interviewed people who had taken loans, and people who might want to take loans.
                                We created a personas for this module:
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="measure">Key takeaways are:</h3>
                        <ul class="goals-list">
                                <li><p>People think they need to provide a collateral to get loans.</p></li>
                                <li><p>People needed to know how much interest they were going to pay and for how long.</p></li>
                                <li><p>People weren't up for the rigorous rigorous risk assessment requirements needed to acquire a loan.</p></li>
                                <li><p>People wanted to be clear they weren't committing to long time liability.</p></li>
                                <li><p>People wanted to know how loans can be repaid.</p></li>
                                <li><p>People were curious as to what happens if they don't meet the deadline for repayment</p></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>One key questioned we asked is: Who gets a loan? All our customer who apply? <br/><br/>
                                We had a session with the entire team, amongst whom was present was a loan professional who laid out what was expected of a customer to be eligible for a loan. There were lots of variables, but following our demographic and target users, we streamlined the requirements to the following
                        </p>
                        <ul class="goals-list">
                                <li><p>Applicant must be in a paid employment of have a business with steady revenue and must provide proof.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Applicant must provide a salary account or business account.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Direct debit mandate.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Account statement of salary or business account for the last 6 months.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We also knew we needed to make the process not only as simple as possible but also as clear as possible so that users can understand fully what they are committing to. We also knew we needed to give applicants the ability to make updates to their loan details or repayment.<br/><br/>
                                Putting all these variable into play, we arrived at a simple loan process, from application, to eligibility, to requirements, approval, repayment and updates.<br/><br/>

                                Since one of people’s concerns was how much interest they had to pay back, and for how long, we thought it made sense to ease loan seeking in, by being transparent - starting the experience with the user knowing fully what their variables could be. We designed simple loan calculator that lets the user input how much they intended to take, interest rate is then populated based on eligibility status and intended duration of payment. This then ushers the user into the loan procurement process which is as simple as providing few requirements, and then getting a loan within 24hrs.

                        <h2>Budgeting</h2>
                        <p>Designing for budgeting, we knew we needed to have more insights about budgeting – What budgeting really is? Why it is important? How do people budget? What steps do people take in building out a budget? And how budgeting can impact peoples' lives.<br/><br/>

                                One thing was clear during our research – budgeting was an after-thought for most people, while some people budgeted. For us, the primary thing was to know the why behind these two user groups. Yinka, a digital marketer told us that he tries to budget in some months, but often finds himself not going according to plan due to unforeseen circumstances and what was clearly a lack of discipline. Jeff, an IT professional said he knows what he needs and goes for it as long as he has the money, but never outlines what and what pre-purchase.<br/><br/>

                                Digging deep, and from conversations, we understood budgeting was simply a plan; in relation to estimated revenue and expenses. The goal was how to make people have a plan, stick to it, gain from it and make it fun.<br/><br/>

                                From the onset, Edmund had told us that the budgeting module of Advance was to be a focal point because it was one core aspect to determined financial status based on income and expenses.<br/><br/>
                                Ideating, we arrived at a simple process for budgeting. Income was key. Why budget if you don't know what your income is. People have specific things they always pay for monthly, like utility bills, rent, internet, insurance etc, while other expenses came on the fly.<br/><br/>

                                We designed a simple process for budgeting. We asked users for their income sources, then expenses – fixed and variable. We let user decided on how much of their income they wanted to budget in a month for expenses because people had no idea what lies ahead, hence the freedom to allow them estimate and cut out what they can afford to spend. The big picture is that as users use the app, Advance starts to learn spending habit, and can then help users make better estimations and decisions.<br/><br/>

                                We asked people what they spent money on the most, and from our expereince knowing the culture of Africans, we came up with list of categories for expenses for fixed expenses and variable expenses, while also given users flexibility to add or remove categories.<br/><br/>
                        
                        

                        After users have set up their budget, if they spend using the Advance app or card, the app automatically categorizes that expense, while tracking the budget for that category, and keeping users in check of their spending. Users can also manually track expenses with just a few taps.<br/><br/>

                                Ultimately, we come up with the idea of a budget bar (meter) which shows budget progress based on what the user has planned. The budget bar acts like a guide to see how a user's finances is doing based on the users income and set expenses, track user spending habit; while keeping the user in check, and ultimately giving the user advise on how to curb unnecessary expenses, and allowing the user know where money is going.</p>

                        This stage of the project unvieled a lot of usability issues. We used Invision for the first stage, and as developers were fleshing out the designs, staff of Advance were mandated to install the done modules on their phone, use, test and provide feedback. Screenshots were sent, as well as notes from various people.
