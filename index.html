					<h6>ABOUT ME</h6>
				<h3>I'm a human driven by relentless curiosity. Asking the question "WHY?" is my super power. My journey into design started by questioning things, growing up watching my relation building apps, I always had something to question, that's how it all began.<br/><br/>
					I believe design is just more than how it works, but most imortantly – how it impacts us. This mentality enables me offer my best in any work I find myself. I enjoy exploring various ways to solve problems and being involved in the whole process of following up ideas from concept to execution through continuous iteration/testing by leveraging the power of design thinking, technology, and business. <br/><br/>
					I'm also particular about the business side of what I'm working on, as well as how it intersects with technology. I code html/css, while exploring how technology interfaces with design, and this knowledge affects how I think about solutions, knowing what is technologically feasible.<br/><br/>
					I've seen the power of collaboration, research and putting people at the center of what we are doing. And so, whether it's a small project I'm working on or a big thing, I bring people into the picture.<br/><br/>
					Expereinces have thought me that I should never think anything about people, but should instead try and see things from their perpectives because people are being influenced by their experiences, hence the need for empathy and human understanding.<br/><br/>
					I'm an ardent reader of books and articles. I also find pleasure in writing. I find time to meditate, watch videos that interests me. The beach is my favorite place.<br/><br/>


					Consulting, working with agencies and startups, I’ve had the opportunity to lead teams while working on projects for businesses like Google, Zenith Bank, GTBank, MNET Africa, Planned Parenthood, Helium; to mention but a few.</h3>
