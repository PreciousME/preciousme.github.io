            <div class="hotels-background">
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Over the years, digital products spearheaded by African start-ups have been pulled to the background by the e-commerce giants, and as the economy wobbles, digital products are jumping out into center stage. With the likes of Paystack, Hotels.ng, Alat, Kudi, OneMedical leading the gang. <br/><br/>

                    Many Nigerian startup founders would have contacted a developer first, like our sister Linda said she did when the idea of LIS (of blessed memory) first hit her. <br/><br/>
                        
                    The reality is that Product Design or User experience Design is a new buzz in this part of the world. Most Startup Founders, Stakeholders, and even Designers are yet to really understand what it is all about, and how it can have an impact on businesses and on people‚Äôs lives.<br/><br/>
                        
                    But until we truly understand and are fearless to make design a core of our businesses, then many of our Startups will continue to suffer stillbirths and will never get to make a leap to funding.<br/><br/>
                    
                    Ponder and ask yourself ‚Äî‚Äù how many African apps do I have installed on my phone? How often do I use it/them? Take a look at my app screens. Yes, troll on me for being a product racist.üò±</p>
                <div class="case-img">
                    <img src="images/app-screen.jpg" alt="">
                    <p class="img-description">My App Screen. Obviously no African app.</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                        I‚Äôm sliced into two with a valyrian sword each time a new product launches in Africa. Glad that we are embracing technology, but sad that these products fail to live up to‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶....what do we even expect?<br/><br/>

                        Some of these startups just buy a template, paste their logo on it, change some text, and that‚Äôs it! No research, no validation, no knowledge of the best technologies to use for when the winter of scaling eventually comes.<br/><br/>
                        
                        The really successful startups are those that solve real people and business problems, by researching, understanding, defining and taking the time to design every bit of the business that comes together to fix those problems. Be it those little features that convert, or designing a team that shares a common vision, and ultimately every aspect of the business.

            <div class="hotels-challenge">
                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>The first time I used hotels.ng, I was very impressed by the aesthetics and design compared to many other indigenous products I had come across. It presented itself as an exciting product to use as a case study on how we can improve on our products as well as design better products that affect people‚Äôs lives.<br/><br/>

                    This is not primarily about showing off some cool features hotels.ng can have, rather it‚Äôs about addressing a bigger problem: we don‚Äôt value design around this side of the globe, probably because we are ignorant of its importance to how we live our lives.<br/><br/>
                    
                    I have used hotels.ng just once, a time I traveled to Uyo for a Friend‚Äôs video shoot. Not enough to start chopping the onions?<br/><br/>
                    
                    But I thought a hotel booking platform could do more than just show me states, hotels in them, and best deals. Vacation, events, business purposes, visit, random travel are all reasons for hotel booking.<br/><br/>
                    
                    With data being key in modern product design, I envisioned a personalized product that learns from user behaviors, patterns, and data, so as to present the user the best options and help people make the right decisions faster.<br/><br/>
                    
                    While the ultimate goal is to make the user‚Äôs journey an easy and personalized one, increasing sales and conversions for the business was not to be forgotten.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="hotels-goals">
                <h2>My Goals</h2>
                <ul class="goals-list">
                    <li><p>To design a more intuitive and personalized experience for hotel booking.</p></li>
                    <li><p>To design a product that inspires, motivates and informs the user.</p></li>
                    <li><p>To invent creative ways to generate more revenue for the business.</p></li>
                    <li><p>To improve the aesthetics of the product to buy trust, and give delight.</p></li>
                    
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="hotels-Process">
                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <h3>User Research & Empathy</h3>
                <p>To understand user problems, I had to empathize with them.
                        Being an advocate against designing on assumptions, I needed to understand user needs. Getting existing users of hotels.ng was a challenge.<br/><br/>

                        Everyone travels, and some people book hotels when they do. So I conducted online and offline interviews with traveler friends, relations and on recommendations. I used Typeform, email, and phone calls to get feedback from people.<br/><br/>
                        
                        I also looked at competitors like Jumia Travel, Wakanow, and Booking.com from where I drafted a competitive analysis which informed some of my decisions.

                <h2>The Discovery</h2>
                <h3>Personal Insights</h3>
                <h4>Value Proposition</h4>
                <p>The first thing I got to realize was the absence of a strong value proposition on the landing page. While it is clearly stated on the about us page, it wasn‚Äôt really evident on the design.<br/><br/>
                    ‚ÄúWhy should I use Hotels.ng out of the many booking products out there?‚Äù I thought.</p><br/>
                <h4>Categorization</h4>
                <p>The prominent categorization on the homepage was by states and best deals. What if I needed to go for a vacation with no idea of where to go to? I would love to be inspired.</p>
